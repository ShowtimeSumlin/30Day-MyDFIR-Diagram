# MyDFIR-SOC Diagram

## Objective

This project provides a diagram created with draw.io to visually represent the roles, responsibilities, and workflow of a SOC (Security Operations Center) Analyst. The diagram is designed to help understand the daily tasks, tools, and processes involved in monitoring, detecting, and responding to security threats.

### Skills Learned

-Understanding SOC Roles and Responsibilities: Gain knowledge of various SOC team roles (e.g., Tier 1, Tier 2 Analysts, Incident Response Lead) and their specific responsibilities.

-Incident Response Workflow Mapping: Learn to visualize and document the step-by-step process of detecting, triaging, analyzing, escalating, mitigating, and reporting security incidents.

-Tool Identification and Integration: Identify key tools used by SOC Analysts (e.g., SIEM, IDS/IPS, threat intelligence platforms) and illustrate how they integrate into the SOC workflow.

-Communication Flow Mapping: Develop skills to depict internal and external communication flows within a SOC, including escalation paths and collaboration with other teams.

-Data Visualization Techniques: Learn to use visual elements like icons, arrows, and color-coding to effectively represent complex processes and relationships in a diagram.

-Diagramming with draw.io: Acquire hands-on experience using draw.io to create and customize diagrams, including learning to use its various shapes, connectors, and templates.

-Process Documentation: Improve your ability to document and explain complex security processes clearly and concisely for stakeholders.

-Critical Thinking and Analysis: Enhance your analytical skills by identifying and logically organizing critical SOC processes and workflows.

-Design and Layout Skills: Develop an eye for design and layout to ensure the diagram is both visually appealing and easy to understand.

-Attention to Detail: Learn to pay attention to small details to ensure the accuracy and clarity of the diagram.

### Tools Used


-draw.io: Primary tool for creating the SOC Analyst diagram, offering a user-friendly interface and a wide range of shapes, icons, and templates suitable for illustrating complex workflows and processes.

-Version Control (Git/GitHub): Used to manage changes, collaborate, and maintain different versions of the diagram.

-Online Resources (e.g., security blogs, threat intelligence sites): Used to gather information on SOC roles, tools, and workflows to ensure accurate representation in the diagram.

## Steps
-Creating Diagram Elements: Used draw.io to add various shapes, lines, and icons representing SOC roles, tools, and processes.

-Customizing Layout and Design: Leveraged draw.io's formatting options (colors, fonts, borders) to make the diagram visually clear and engaging.

-Connecting Workflow Steps: Used connectors and arrows to illustrate the flow of tasks and communication between different SOC roles.

-Incorporating Icons and Symbols: Added relevant security tool icons (e.g., SIEM, firewall) and symbols to enhance the diagramâ€™s context and clarity.

-Layer Management: Used layers in draw.io to separate different parts of the diagram (e.g., roles, tools, workflows) for better organization and easier editing.

-Exporting and Sharing: Exported the diagram in various formats (e.g., PNG, PDF) for sharing, documentation, or inclusion in reports.
